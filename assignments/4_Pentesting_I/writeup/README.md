## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

I started out by using the nc command given to us in the documentation. Once i put that command in i was asked to input a DNS or IP address. SInce i was clueless i entered the domain name for 1337bank.money, this gave me absolutely nothing. So i eventually searched online for command line injections. I then got introduced some basic commands that would help me achieve this. The first command tried was `;ls` this gave me a bunch of folders and hence i thought i was on the correct path. Next, i searched a little more and that led me to the command `;bash` which gave me the capability to interact with the shell like a simple unix one. To find the flag i first started playing around with the folders and directories. I rembered that in one of the past assignments the flag was under home and hence i looked there and found flag.txt. Then i just did `cat flag.txt` and found the flag `CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}`. There are many ways to prevent command like injections. The first one being regular expression. Usign regular expression we can sort out any invalid or suspicious commands for example /\sls/. Second could be providing limited access to command line over the client side. Third, they could whitelst certain special characters such as `;` and `&` so that the command injection can not be used. Finally, the best way is to avoid access to command line at all.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

For this part i first searched the internet on how to make a shell in python. I came across this cmd library which lets you create a shell using the inbuilt CMD module. The difficult part was to keep track of the current directory and also making sure we can go back one directory. For the `pull` command i first made sure the file existed and then wrote it to the the `local-file`.
