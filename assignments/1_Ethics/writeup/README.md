### Part 2 (75 pts)

The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. I believe that this situation is no different. Having found a vulnerability is as much of a failure as having bugs on production realease of the software. Also since its a large automative company we will be taking over a big risk by not looking into this because this could affect the lives of certain people. Hence, I would take it up with my seniors but before doing that I would also do a research on the ethics and laws of the company so that I have a strong argument when I present my case. It would also be helpful for me to do a cost/benefit analysis before going up to my boss because we might have different interest, mine being scurity and his being profit of the compnay. Even after this my company decides not to postpone the ECU's release, I would convince my boss to let us keep working on the security issues and keep patching it up in small releases. However, if i do nothing and something happens at some level i would consider myself guilty. This is because as a developer it was my duty to make sure these kinds of things do not happen and make software that does good to all.
